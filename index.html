                        <p class="lead mb-0">An MMORPG game that in its latest edition "Navissos" uses Neo4J and Redis databases. Neo4J is used for the very data structure and connections in the game such as the players, characters, their classes, territories, achievements, equipment and others. Redis is used to cache dialogue between characters during gameplay and any transactions that don't need to be done immediately, the virtual store will be shared between all players, so it will be constantly cached for faster interactions. Notice that the main focus on this group project was the database not the game itself, that's why instead of the actual game there is a webpage for testing out database operations.</p>
